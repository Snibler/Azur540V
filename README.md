# Azur540V
This is the sample of coding the processor based on Arduino NANO ATmega328P in Eclipse IDE for C/C++.
The main aim of processor to manage the modules of old DVD Receiver such as tuner based on chip LV23002M, sound processor BD3873FS,
display driver with key scanner PT6311, to play music.
Besides of communicating with peripheral chips, IR controlling and encoder function realized.
